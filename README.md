# Gender Classification

Gender Prediction project using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). I made a model project with pre-trained model [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) which is the winner of [ImageNet challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) in 2015. 
With ResNet and carefully chosen hyperparameters, we achieved `97.56%` accuracy
