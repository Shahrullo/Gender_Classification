# Gender Classification

Gender Prediction project using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). I made a model project with pre-trained model [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) which is the winner of [ImageNet challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) in 2015. 
With ResNet and carefully chosen hyperparameters, we achieved `97.56%` accuracy

## Prerequisites

Thinks you have to install or installed on your working machine:

- Python 3.8.5
- Numpy 
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib 
- Jupyter Notebook
- Torchvision 
- PyTorch 

You can install the required packages by executing the following command.

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Environment:
 - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Jupyter Notebook

`Gender Classification.ipynb`

The jupyter notebook describes the whole project. You can find the whole description inside the notebook.

### How to use it 
Open `Gender Classification.ipynb` on a jupyter notebook environment, or Google colab and run it.

## Training Result
`Got 11365/11649 with accuracy *97.56*`
