    "In this notebook we will use [Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset) from Kaggle. This is a dataset with cropped images of male and female. It is split into training and validation directory. Training contains ~23,000 images of each class and validation directory contains ~5,500 iamges of each class. Our *goal* is to correctly predict gender: `male` or `female`. \n",

    "To achieve better result, we will use [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)(Residual Network) model variants. ResNet was designed for the [ImageNet challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/), and won it in 2015."
